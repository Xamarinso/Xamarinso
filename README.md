### Hi! 👋 I'm Stéphane 👨‍💻

I'm an open-source software engineer. I'm passionate about languages, parsers and formats. I'm currently working on continuously bringing joy to mobile developers: [dotnet MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui) (né [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms)).
